# SMU Bachelor of Science (Economics) Python Programming Workshop
Included in this repository are iPython notebooks, datasets, images and code written for the Python Programming workshop held in SMU for Bachelor of Science (Economics) students, in AY2020-2021. In this workshop, we will be going through fundamental programming concepts, aimed at helping students gain a basic understanding of programming. 

If there are any problems with the code, please send an email to bolin.ng.2018@phdecons.smu.edu.sg

## Introduction to Python Programming
Information will be dissected using the Github README, as well as through email. Please download this Github repository on your local computer - we will be using Jupyter Notebooks to read the files.

## Course Outline
For AY2020-2021, the course outline will be as follows:
1. Introduction and Motivation, Syntax, Operations, Data Types and Data Structures
2. Loops, Conditional Statements, Functions and Classes
3. Data Processing, Cleaning and Manipulation with Pandas and NumPy
4. Data Plotting with Seaborn and Matplotlib
5. APIs

## Programs
For this workshop, you are required to install the Anaconda program. The open-source Anaconda Distribution is the easiest way to perform Python/R data science and machine learning on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X, and contains useful tools and libraries for data manipulation purposes. 

Throughout the duration of the workshop, we will be using Jupyter notebooks as the main IDE (Interactive Development Environment), as an IDE is able to provide instant feedback on our code.

You can find more information on how to download the program [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). We will be using Python 3.7; please refrain from downloading the Python 2.7 version.
