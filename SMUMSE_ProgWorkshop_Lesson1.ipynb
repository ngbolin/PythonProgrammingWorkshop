    "# SMU Master of Science (Economics) Programming Workshop in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This is an introductory course/workshop in Programming with Python, aimed at achieving the following objectives:\n",
    "1. Give a brief introduction/overview of Python\n",
    "2. Equip students with foundational programming knowledge for the MSc Programme in Economics\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the duration of the course, we will learn programming using a application-based approach. For most of the course, students will be required to write code (given in the form of in-class assignments) - this is probably the best way to learn coding/programming. More often than not, we are not interested in whether you got the answer right or wrong; indeed, the logic behind the code is more important. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class Breakdown\n",
    "The specific breakdown for the class (which runs for 195 minutes) is given below (subjected to change, of course):\n",

    "1. Lesson Material - 50 minutes\n",
    "2. Break - 15 minutes\n",
    "3. Lesson Material - 50 minutes\n",
    "4. Break - 15 minutes\n",
    "5. Lesson Material - 50 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "Please feel free to ask any burning questions you may have during lesson time; if we happen to have some time left after the class, we can jump right in to the next chapter. We can also include additional chapters!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Course Outline\n",
    "The course will be split into the following modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction, Syntax, Operations and Data Structures\n",
    "2. Loops, Conditional Statements, Functions and Classes\n",
    "3. NumPy and Pandas - Data Cleaning, Reading and Manipulation\n",
    "4. Matplotlib and Seaborn - Data Plotting\n",
    "5. Regular Expressions and Text Analysis\n",
    "6. Advanced Topics in Programming - Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's class, we will be covering the first module on syntax, operations and data structures."

    "## Basic Syntax and Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early days of programming, users have to key in specific code that the machine can interpret for any action to be taken by the machine. For example, Fortran and C are 2 languages that are of a \"low-level\"; that is, they are languages that can easily be interpreted by the computer (think of it as speaking directly to the computer):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/fortran_code.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in recent times, for sake of simplicity and convenience, new languages, such as R and Python, tend to be of a \"higher level\"; that is, they have a build-in interpreter that acts like a \"translator\" for the computer that takes what we key in as the inputs and outputs machine-readable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the benefits of Python and R therefore stems from the fact that it is easily readable and understood, but comes as the expense of slightly slower computation timings. As long as we are not dealing with *Big Data*, this shouldn't come as an issue, however. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will start off with a quick introduction to syntax (grammar) and operations in Python. As a start, we will be using Python both as a way to store things that we are interested in storing, and a calculator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these examples, we will be using simple functions such as print, type, int and float.\n",

    "In this section of the class, I will show an example of why lists and dictionaries are so important and powerful in computing. Consider the following problem, where we have a specific text, and we need to find the number of times each word appears in the text (suppose we have 10,000 texts with 10,000 words each). This may be because we expect words that appear more frequently to be more important or provide more information about the text.\n",

This is one of the best approaches towards problem solving (in computing, at least): break the problem down into many segments, and solve for each segment. Then, combine the solutions and see if we can find a \"global\" solution.\n",
