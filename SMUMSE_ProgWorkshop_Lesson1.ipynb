    "## Introduction\n",
    "This is an introductory course/workshop in Programming with Python, aimed at achieving the following objectives:\n",
    "1. Give a brief introduction/overview of Python\n",
    "2. Equip students with foundational programming knowledge for the MSc Programme in Economics\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the duration of the course, we will learn programming using an application-based approach. For most of the course, students will be required to write code (in the form of in-class assignments) - this is probably the best way to learn coding/programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "More often than not, we are not interested in whether you got the answer right or wrong - we are more interested in the way you think about the question, and your approach towards solving it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Course Outline\n",
    "The course will be split into the following modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction, Syntax, Operations and Data Structures\n",
    "2. Loops, Conditional Statements, Functions and Classes\n",
    "3. NumPy and Pandas - Data Cleaning, Reading and Manipulation\n",
    "4. Matplotlib and Seaborn - Data Plotting\n",
    "5. Algorithms\n",

    "\n",
    "In the earlier days of programming, humans have to key in specific code (machine-readable code) that the machines can interpret in order for them to execute the action specified. For example, Fortran and C are 2 such \"low-level\" languages - they are languages that can be easily interpreted by the computer, but not necessarily easy for humans to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/fortran_code.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in recent times, for sake of simplicity and convenience, newer languages, such as R and Python, are \"higher-level\" languages - they have a build-in interpreter that translates what we provide as code/inputs for the machine to interpret/execute\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, one benefit of newer languages such as Python and R stems from its readability and simplicity, but comes at the cost of longer computation. This wouldn't be an issue as long as we are not dealing with *Big Data*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will start off with a quick introduction to the syntax (or grammar) and basic operations of the Python language - this will give you a taste of what Python can and cannot do.\n",

While this distinction seems pretty trivial right now, when you begin to write longer chunks of code, naming conventions make it easy for other readers to know what you're doing, and for you to follow what you're actually doing. In addition, having variables with uninformative names makes it difficult to carry on writing code if you need to call these variables in the future.\n",

    "Writing comments also help your readers understand what each block of code (be it a loop, function or conditional statements) are doing. As you begin to write more and more code, and begin to call previously defined functions, it becomes very difficult for your readers (and you) to follow what's going on. Writing comments can often help to reduce the reading burden of your readers.\n",
