    "\"For\" loops are traditionally used when you have a block of code which you want to repeat a fixed number of times. The Python \"for\" statement iterates over the members of a sequence in order, executing the block each time, and \"while\" loops are typically used when a condition needs to be checked each iteration, or to repeat a block of code forever.\n",

    "6. zip( )\n",
    "7. int( )\n",
    "8. float( )\n",
    "\n",
    "What do they have in common? Apart from the fact that they turn green when you type them in the Jupyter Notebook, they have round brackets ( ), which we can then input arguments for the functions. This begs the question: what exactly is an argument, then? \n",
