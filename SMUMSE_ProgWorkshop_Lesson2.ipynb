    "We begin this module with a simple question: what exactly are functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "From [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp), a function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. While this doesn't actually say much, it kind of implies that a function consists of proper code that can do whatever you want it to do, so long as it is computationally probable and possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've seen quite a few functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. print( )\n",
    "2. range( )\n",
    "3. list( )\n",
    "4. dict( )\n",
    "5. len( )\n",
    "6. zip( )\n",
    "7. int( )\n",
    "8. float( )\n",
    "\n",
    "What do they have in common? Apart from the fact that they turn green when you type them in the Jupyter Notebook, they have round brackets ( ), which we can then input arguments for the functions. This begs the question: what exactly is an argument, then? \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we answer that question, we appeal to the '?' function in Python."
